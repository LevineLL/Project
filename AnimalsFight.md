## [Description]
Animals fight, enjoy, play
I still remember when we used the paper to play the game of the arena on the ground, carefree, laughter, and now the phone can also play, let's relax together!

game rules:
1. At the beginning of the game, a player first checks the chess, and the color that is turned to determines the color of the two parties controlling the piece;
2. Each player controls one piece per turn, flips the board or moves the piece to a square;
3. The order of the size of the pieces: like > lion > tiger > leopard > wolf > dog > cat > mouse > elephant, the mouse can eat like oh, if the same pieces touch each other, the two will die together;

There are more casual puzzle games, and you can enjoy the game together! !
